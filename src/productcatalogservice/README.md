# Produce Catalog Service

a little go service. This one looks fun to modify

## supposedly

When this service is run the output should be similar to the following

```json
{"message":"successfully parsed product catalog json","severity":"info","timestamp":"2022-06-02T23:54:10.191283363Z"}
{"message":"starting grpc server at :3550","severity":"info","timestamp":"2022-06-02T23:54:10.191849078Z"}
```
